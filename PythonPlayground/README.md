[Playground](./Playground.py) is a Python file where I've created various Python functions for practice and experimentation. Many functions are inspired by challenges from [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3), marked with their difficulty level in comments above them. Functions without a difficulty level noted are either original or sourced from other places online. Everything here is manually coded, without AI assistance, as a way to learn Python syntax and improve problem-solving skills. [Playground](./Playground.py) is essentially my playground for when I get bored.

I wanted to learn how to play the piano and I understood that mastering sheet music is the essential first step for learning piano. I designed [musicFlashCards](./musicFlashCards/main.py) to simulate flashcards for efficient practice. These flashcards show up as images and you decide whether they show up as the treble clef, bass clef, or the notes themselves (A-G) by specifying which method to call in the code.
